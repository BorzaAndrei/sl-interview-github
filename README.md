## Task

Using the Github Gist API, I'm creating a single-app page using Django as my Web framework. The application will allow users to enter a username
and get a full list of public Gists for that user.

Functionalities:
[] search - when a user enters an username, they will receive a full list of public Gists by that user
[] fileTypes - converts the filetypes of the files in the Gist into a tag/badge
[] forks - includes with the list of the Gists the username/avatar of the last 3 users who have forked it
[] Gist contents - when clicking one of the Gists, display the content of the file
[] styling with CSS (Flex or Grid recommended)
